What is Parvalish?<br>
Much like unagi
It is not something you do 
But something you are!<br></font><center></p>
<p><center><font color="black" size="5">
Being parvalish means -
Surprising people with breaking window panes to show that it might break<br>
It is being sweet and brilliant and sometimes both on the same date<br>
And having a heart of diamond which loves truly<br>
And cares for everyone around and is friendly!<br></p>
<p><center><font color="black" size="5">
Being parvalish means being cute enough to make strictest profs like shubhi mam smile<br>
And forgetting what you had been saying just before a little while<br>
It means having the most melodious voice <br>
You are the luckiest if you get to hear it in a day twice<br></p>
<p><center><font color="black" size="5">
Parvalish means taking things lite even after understanding all emotions<br>
And while explaining something moving your hands in circular motions<br>
It means being nervous about being consistent<br>
But at the same time trying hard is constant.<br></p>
<p><center><font color=" green"size="3">Footnotes- A person may possess every quality mentioned above.But still, Parvalish is a unique trait only in Prabal Patwa. And that makes him special and irreplacable.
